# Furnicraze
This is a full-stack collaboration project between Peter Chusid and Miles Echavez.
We welcome you to our ecommerce website, a platform designed to help you buy furniture easily and conveniently. Our website was built using React, Redux, JavaScript, CSS, and Firebase for the backend. These technologies were chosen because they offer robust capabilities for web development, including building dynamic user interfaces, managing data, and handling user authentication.
