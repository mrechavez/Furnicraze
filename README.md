This is a full-stack collaboration project between Peter Chusid and Miles Echavez.
We welcome you to our ecommerce website, a platform designed to help you buy furniture easily and conveniently. Our website was built using React, Redux, JavaScript, CSS, and Firebase for the backend. These technologies were chosen because they offer robust capabilities for web development, including building dynamic user interfaces, managing data, and handling user authentication.

Our website features a range of key functionality to enhance the user experience. User login and authentication ensures secure access to the site, while search and filter functionality helps users quickly find the products they need. The ability to add items to a shopping cart and checkout makes the purchasing process simple and convenient. In addition, our website includes an admin panel to add and manage products, orders, and users, making it easy to keep the site up-to-date and manage customer accounts.

We hope you enjoy using our ecommerce website and find it easy to navigate and use. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or feedback.
